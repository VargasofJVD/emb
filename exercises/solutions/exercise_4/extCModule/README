The dht11Raw module with the function dht11ReadRaw must be included in the
MicroPython binary.
In order to accomplish this I created a directory user_modules on the same
level in the file system as the MicroPython sources. In this directory I
included dht11Raw with the C source code of the module: dht11Raw and an file
describing how to build the module that will be included in the Makefile
building MicroPython
MicroPython must then be built with:
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../user_modules CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DMODULE_DHT11RAW_ENABLED
which adds the module to the system and enables it.
