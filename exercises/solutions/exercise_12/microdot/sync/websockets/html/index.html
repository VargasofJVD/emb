<h1>Sending SHT30 sensor data over websockets with picoweb</h1>
<p>This is a WEB server, based on picoweb, which sends SHT30 temperature and
  humidity data to a browser using websockets. Also via websockets it receives
  information in which state the user LED on the ESP32 should be and it
  controls the LED correspondingly. Please try IP_of_WebServer/sensor.html to
